# Cargo-Delivery-System
Hacettepe University BBM203, Assignment 3 Fall 2020.

I implemented a cargo delivery simulation. According to this simulation, you are given several cities. In each city, there exists a cargo station which consists of cargo packages and cargo trucks.  Cargo truck and cargo packages at the specified city and by following the given route, arrive at the destination city, leaving and taking cargo packages from the cities you visit. I created a program that reads the input about the cargo packages from the input files and after completing the missions, produces an output file exhibiting the final state of the stations at each city.

After compiling, need to use, dos2unix <deck_file> <commands_file> to not get an
wrong representation.
